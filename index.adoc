== What is Complexity? 

[quote, https://www.etymonline.com/word/complex]
**complex** (_adj_), 1650s: "composed of interconnected parts, formed by a combination of simple things or elements"
from _com_ - with, _together_ + _plectere_ "to wear, braid, twine, entwine".


== Why do we have it? 
=== It's an essential property
[quote, Fred Brooks, No Silver Bullet]
The complexity of software is an essential property, not an accidental one. Hence, descriptions of a software entity that abstract away its complexity often abstract away its essence.

=== The problem domain is complex
[quote, Martin Fowler, Forward to Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans]
There are many things that make software development complex. But the heart of this complexity is the essential intricacy of the problem domain itself.

== The Hidden Complexity
Combining the growing complexity of the domain and the complexity of the technical solution.

== My Mission
To try to tame the beasts of complexity by keeping the domain and technical complexities separate. Relatedly, I've been haunted by this tweet, for forty days and forty nights.

== Introducing: Dragon Drip
_Dragon Drip_ is a small-batch coffee roaster that sources raw coffee beans and sells roasted blends online.

I identified 12 _flows_ to get a first 'end-to-end slice' through the business.

=== Add Bean
Adds a new bean to the inventory

=== Add Purchase Order
Adds a new purchase order to the system

=== Receive Purchase Order
* Mark purchase order as received
* Update inventory with the received beans

=== Add Roast Type
Adds a new roast type to the system (e.g. French roast)

===  Add Product
* Adds a new product to the system for sale on the shop
* is associated with a mix of beans, and a roast type
* Has a price
* Availibility is determined directly by stock level in the inventory.

=== Add to Basket
* Adds a product to the basket in the shop
* Max basket weight can be 10kg
* Orders over $50 are free shipping

=== Place order
* Represents a customer placing an order
* Order is set to be prepared (roasting is more or less on demand)

=== Processing orders
* Not really a user flow, but would be if we didn't do it in our domain
* We demand the amount of roasted beans required for all orders in the batch that need to be shipped today 
* For each order this could be a combination of roasts types and amounts of a certain bean across many order items
* Across all order items in the batch, we generate a series of demands
* Beans are roasted in multiples of 1kg, but sold in quantities of 250g, so there's a mix of roasted and unroasted coffee around, with different use-by dates

=== Roast Beans
* Beans can only be roasted in minimum 1kg batches
* Starts the use by date countdown
* Roasts are now ready to be allocated to orders

=== Packing order items
* Preparing the coffee blends and putting them in bags

=== Ship
* Orders are packed themselves when the each order item has been packed, and then shipped.

== Design it Twice
[quote, John Ousterhout, A Philosophy of Software Design]
Designing software is hard, so it's unlikely that your first thoughts about how to structure a module or system will produce the best design. You'll end up with a much better result if you consider multiple options for each major design decision: **design it twice**.


== 1. Domain Driven Design
My first attempt was Domain-driven design (DDD). In Domain-driven design the domain is the heart of the software, and everything else revolves around it.

=== Domain model
In DDD a series of types of object are defined that represent the real world domain. High attention is paid to a 'ubiquitous language' between the domain experts (client) and the developers. e.g. if they call it an 'SDR', we call it an 'SDR' in the code. 

=== Layered architecture

=== Positives

=== Identifying different types of objects

There's a difference between an `Entity`, where you care about the thing's _identity_ (e.g. an Order), and a `Value Object`, where you care about the thing's _value_ (e.g. an Address). It takes a while, but thinking about the objects not *automatically* as an ActiveRecord is a good exercise.

=== Separation of Concerns

The Domain never knows what application it's being run in, so it can never think about it. It does know that it has *some* kind of persistence mechanism, but it doesn't know what it is - (it's injected in).

=== The Domain is where *everything happens*
So much so that I was able to put a Sinatra app and a CLI app over the same domain, and they just handled the user's flow, not the decisions that were being made.

- In the CLI app, an in memory database was used
- In the Sinatra app, a CSV was used as the database
- The Domain still doesn't know any of those things exist. 

=== Layered takeaway for our Rails apps
With broadcasting we actually violate the 'layered architecture' flow in a very interesting way. The Application Layer, sometimes all the way down to our 'domain' layer, knows about HTML.

[source, ruby]
----
class Projects::Update
  def maybe_broadcast_to_live_finance
    return unless project.status.in? LIVE_FINANCE_STATUSES

    Projects::LiveFinance.add(project) if project.saved_change_to_status? && project.live_financing?

    #  We know if the HTML is already on the page or not
    Projects::LiveFinance.replace(project)
  end
end
----

=== Testing
+ Domain tests are fast (there's no database)

=== Negatives

=== You always go all the way through the stack on every action.

=== Testing

Because everything is so isolated, it's all mocks and stubs.

```
OrderRepository
  #find_by_id
    when the persistence layer returns a order
      behaves like a successful result
    when the persistence layer raises an exception
      behaves like a failure result
  #save
    calls the save on the persistence layer with the order
    behaves like a successful result
  #all
    behaves like a successful result
```

=== Repositories
They're fine, but, I still ended up thinking very CRUDily.

=== Writing it all out by hand
When it comes to writing `#save`, `#find` etc, Rails gives me a lot for free. I'm used to it. 

== 2. 'Functional Core, Imperative Shell'

Push the I/O to the edges, and keep the *decision making* in a core that is pure and functional.

The edges are larger than in DDD - they handle the Technical Complexity. The core is as complex as your Domain.

@product.save
----

=== Boolean. What else does it do?

[source, ruby]
----
@product.save # => Boolean
----

=== It changes the @product object. What else could it return?

[source, ruby]
----
@product.save # => [Boolean, @product*] (@product has also changed)
----

=== Holy S#!t
[source, ruby]
----
@product.save # => [Boolean, @product*,
              #              AdapterNotFound,
              #              AdapterNotSpecified,

              #              Error]
----

=== What else could it do?
Absolutely anything.

[source, ruby]
----
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  before_save :set_defaults, :apply_discounts, :calculate_total, if: :new_record?
  before_save :adjust_inventory
  before_save :check_order_limits, if: :bulk_order?

  validates :status, inclusion: { in: %w[pending paid shipped completed canceled] }

  before_validation :sanitize_data, on: :create
  after_commit :log_order_change, on: %i[create update]
end
----

== Building the Core
- A document of what the business problem does.
- When developing, I'm *only* thinking about the domain problem.

=== An example flow

[source, ruby]
----
class ReceivePurchaseOrder < ServiceObject
  def call(purchase_order:, recipient_id:, received_on:)
    receipt_details = ReceiptDetails.new(recipient_id:, received_on:)

    updated_purchase_order = purchase_order.receive(receipt_details)

    # Return a command to store the updated purchase order
    Success([UpdatePurchaseOrder.new(updated_purchase_order),
             IncrementRawStock.new(bean_id: updated_purchase_order.bean_id,
                                   g: updated_purchase_order.g)])
  end
end
----

=== The Command
Just a signal of intent.

[source, ruby]
----
class IncrementRawStock
  attr_reader :bean_id, :g

  def initialize(bean_id:, g:)
    @bean_id = bean_id
    @g = g
  end
end
----

==== Handling the command

[source, ruby]
----
result = Flows::ReceivePurchaseOrder.call(**args)

return result if result.failure?

result.commands.each do |cmd|
  case cmd
  when IncrementRawStock
    StockLevel.find_by(bean_id: cmd.bean_id).increment(cmd.g)
  when SomeOtherCommand
  else
    raise UnknownCommandError
  end
----

=== Testing
+ There isn't a single mock or stub in the core when it's tested, they're all just objects, there's nothing to mock!

+ The 'unit test' isn't each file, most of them don't really *do* anything other than house data. We unit test the *Flow*, which has been designed to map to a real-world person's goal:

== The Lego Problem
Because it's all just in memory, we can chain things together much more safely inside the core, but to do so, we need a shared way of joining them together.

=== Introducing the Result Monad

[quote]
A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?

=== It's a wrapper.

[source, ruby]
----
# if you're happy, return your result in a Success
# If you're not happy, return it in a Failure.

def validate_user(user)
  if user.valid?
    Success(user)
  else
    Failure(user.errors)
  end
end
----

=== Using the wrapper

[source, ruby]
----
result = validate_user(user)

if result.success?
  DoSomethingElse.call(success.value!)
else
  puts result.failure
end
----

=== This gives us lego

Imagine we're:
* validating the user
* checking the stock level of the basket 
* processing payment
* then creating an order.

=== More useful in the I/O

Although this is a very *functional* pattern, and it's been quite nice to say "everything returns success or failure", the power is probably best used for wrapping uncertainites. 

Remember this?
